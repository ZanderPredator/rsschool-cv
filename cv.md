### Brief information about yourself: Positive, responsive and responsible. The purpose of why I am here is to get the directed knowledge of specialists. There is no work experience in the field of development. I will try to complete this course!) Good luck to me!).

#### Skills: the programming language that hooked me at this stage of my life is JS!) GitHub is a cool system, but it's hard. I use Visual Studio Code.
```
array = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
let doubleArray = array.map(item => item*2)
expected result [2,4,6,8,10,12]
```
#### There is no experience as a Junior Dev at all. I tried to take a JS / FRONT-END course. STAGE 0 (RU) in 2022, but never finished. I was very upset for not scoring points.
#### I graduated from the Sukhoi State Technical University, after graduation I worked as an energy engineer, a esigner of engineering systems.
#### My English level  = А1
