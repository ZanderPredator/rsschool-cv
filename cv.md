### Brief information about yourself: Positive, responsive and responsible. The purpose of why I am here is to get the directed knowledge of specialists. There is no work experience in the field of development. I will try to complete this course!) Good luck to me!)

#### Skills: the programming language that hooked me at this stage of my life is JS!) GitHub is a cool system, but it's hard. I use Visual Studio Code

```
let array = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
let doubleArray = array.map(item => item*2)
// expected result [2,4,6,8,10,12]
```
